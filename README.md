Accenture Forage Task: Social Media Analysis

This repository documents the task assigned by Accenture on the Forage.com platform, where I had the opportunity to learn and execute the end-to-end process of handling client requirements, data preparation, visualization, and presentation. This task offered insights into the essential steps involved in delivering valuable insights to clients and stakeholders.

Task Overview
The primary objective of this task was to understand and demonstrate the step-by-step process of turning raw client requirements into meaningful insights using data. The task covered the following key areas:

Requirements Gathering: Learning to gather and comprehend the client's needs and expectations effectively. This stage involved clear communication, active listening, and thorough requirements documentation.

Data Cleaning: Exploring the crucial process of cleaning and preprocessing raw data. This step ensured that the data used for analysis and visualization was accurate, consistent, and free from errors.

Data Visualization: Creating compelling visual representations of the processed data. Visualization aids in understanding patterns, trends, and relationships within the data, making it easier to communicate insights to stakeholders.

Report Generation: Developing comprehensive reports that summarize the findings from the data analysis. Reports provide a structured overview of the insights and support decision-making processes.

Power BI Dashboard: Building interactive dashboards using Power BI to provide stakeholders with a user-friendly interface for exploring the data and gaining insights in real time.
